Project Summary
The site I have chosen to redesign is the Comox Valley Farmers Market website. URL: https://cvfm.ca/. The most important purpose of this website is to communicate information about when farmers' markets are happening, the types of markets, and how to find them. The target audience is individuals over the age of 30. Marketing is aimed at health-conscious individuals, generally female, and in a higher tax bracket. The overall message I want to communicate with the target audience is where/when to find farmers' markets and the benefits of attending them. The action I want users to take before leaving my website is to sign up for the newsletter for reminders. This website is inadequate for several reasons. Using Lighthouse Developer tools the Comox Valley Farmers Market Website received a 62% performance rating, a 71% accessibility rating, a 75% best practices rating, and a 92% SEO rating. This website does not follow best practices for typography, hierarchy, and affordance. It is confusing and overwhelming in parts and is not easy to read. There is no action that the user is intended to perform before they leave the page. It also received a failing score on the PageSpeed Insights analysis tool.

Look and Feel
Mood: the mood I want to convey is clean and minimalistic. I want it to be calming, positive, fresh and natural.
Inspiration: Qualicum Farmers Market https://www.qbfarmersmarket.com/ and BC Farmers Market https://bcfarmersmarket.org/
Color palette: Navy blue #0b132b Green #87986a Light green #cfe1b9 yellow #f9e784
Images: logo.svg,summermarket, wintermarket
Fonts: The type face they use is unavailable on Google Fonts and the closet font to the original is a v nariable fonts. Additionally, the typeface they used is not cohesive with the mood I am developing for the page. Therefore, fonts used will be: Poppins, and Amatic SC

### About Us

The Comox Valley Farmersâ€™ Market Association in a not for profit society that has been bringing local food to local folks since 1992. Over the last twenty-five plus years we have grown from a seasonal Saturday market with a dozen vendors selling product off the tailgate of their pickup truck to a year-round Saturday market and two seasonal markets with over one hundred vendors selling a wide array of products that are grown, made, baked, raised or wild harvested within the Comox Valley and Strathcona Regional District.

### More than a market

The market is not only a place to pick up your weekly groceries but a healthy family-oriented community gathering place where you can meet and catch up over a cup of hot coffee and a cinnamon bun while listening to the live local entertainment. There are lots of opportunities to taste something new or gather ideas about spicing up an old favorite. There is something for everyone.
